# Homework_01_refractor
(I know it's refactor but I changed it to refractor to save with a unique ID)

Created more specific id's and div names to make it easier to understand the section of code you are looking at.
Matched images to be included since path change when creating my own save file,
Fixed ID for search-engine-optimization.
Condensed any id's I could for CSS since it seemed to be "DRY" in some places
